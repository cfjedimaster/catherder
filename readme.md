# Cat Herder

I'll write more here later, honest.

## Notes

As I think of stuff, I add it here. 

Cat traits:
	zoomies: mood changes 2 to 3x
	crazy: even if mood=X and you do X, you don't get credit, you need a random chance 
	grumpy: needs high happiness to purr

to buy with purrs:

automatic feeders/petters/boxes each do the appropriate click per second to a cat, with the
num of each being how many cats covered, starting from index 0

cats... i THINK i may want them to just show up randomly too and 'adopt' you

notes for firefly: 
landscape, art, style: themes/cartoon
