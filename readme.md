# Cat Herder

Cat Herder is an "idle clicker" game where you as the lucky cat parent get to try your best to keep your fur babies happy. Each cat has three basic needs - to be fed, petted, or ignored, and you have to do your best to meet those needs! Good luck!

## Notes

As I think of stuff, I add it here. 

Cat traits:
	zoomies: mood changes 2 to 3x
	crazy: even if mood=X and you do X, you don't get credit, you need a random chance 
	grumpy: needs high happiness to purr

to buy with purrs:

automatic feeders/petters/boxes each do the appropriate click per second to a cat, with the
num of each being how many cats covered, starting from index 0

cats... i THINK i may want them to just show up randomly too and 'adopt' you

notes for firefly: 
landscape, art, style: themes/cartoon


## Changelog

* 6/5/2024: Machines now add to happiness for each cat up to the # of machines. So X feeders will feed the first X cats. Also reduced the amount of purrs needed to enable machines. Also simplified machine cost. I still have methods for each 3 types and I could reduce that, but keeping them in case I reverse the decision. 

* 6/4/2024: Added flag for when machines are enabled. Added machine display and ability to purchase. Machines don't do anything yet. Oh, added money cheat to the cheats. 

* 5/25/2024: Initial release
